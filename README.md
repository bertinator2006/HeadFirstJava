# HeadFirstJava
this  is me learning java

i am using the book head first java and wiil slowly move into the book: programming principles and practice using c plus plus

this will give me an idea of what the code is actually doing and how to code properly.

the second book will presumably teach me how to be a better programmer and how to make "easy to read" code
